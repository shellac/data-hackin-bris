"From 1911 Long Ashton Poor Law Union comprised the registration districts of Long Ashton Rural District; Clevedon Urban "
"District; and Portishead Urban District. After 1920 data were only given for registration districts with a population over 10,000, "
"and thus Portishead and Clevedon were no longer included. Only the data for Long Ashton district within the union were still "
"recorded."
